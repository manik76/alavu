1.0 Introduction
----------------

    Alavu is a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition)
package. Acquires data  at the rate of 1 sample/second
for 10 minute interval. Provides different views for the 
acquired signal in IntervalMap, InstantMap and VirtualMap.  
Enables to classify signals in to different views in ClassEdit.
Collects data from remote server. Logs data of all channels every hour 
for the one week duration. Gives Statistical report and Fourier Spectrum 
of logged data.
 
2.0 IntervalMap
---------------

    Gives the user with 10 minutes trend display of two channels.
Provides two-dimension display with X-axis timescale in seconds and
Y-axis process values in respective units. Enables to differntiate
two channels by displaying One-channel in one-colour and other channel 
in other-colour. Gives tagname, processunits, processlow and processhigh
along Y-axis.
 

3.0 InstantMap
--------------

    Gives the user with instant value of process updated for every
one seconds. Provides rectangle display and matrix of
current process value. Provides rectangle with filled region forms 
rectangle display. Provides set of closely packed rectangle
with tagname, process value forms matrix display. Gives alarm
displays through variation in colour in matrix display.  
      

4.0 VirtualMap
--------------

    Provides virtual map of process structure associated with it process
values. Process structure is a static map supplied in the form of image
file.

5.0 ClassEdit
-------------
    
    Provides domain of signals(tagname) in the list and also choices of 
classes like IntervalMap, InstantMap and VirtualMap.  


6.0 Log
-------

    Hourly data are logged for the duration of one week. 

7.0 Analysis
------------

    Provides Statistic Report and Fourier Spectrum for
the given channel and given log data.
